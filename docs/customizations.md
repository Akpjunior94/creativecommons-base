There are three layouts in the theme you can use to configure the structure of your pages. The layouts are:

#### Default Layout

![Default page layout](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/creativecommons-base/assets/content-images/customizations/default-page.png)

This is the default layout of the page template, it has a default sidebar component on the left. To populate the sidebar with widgets:

- View the page on the **Live Preview**
- Go to **Customize** > **Widgets** > **Page**
- View the <g-link to="/customizations#widgets">Widgets</g-link> section to learn how you can configure the widgets.

#### No Sidebar Layout

This layout is structured like the Default layout but it does not have the sidebar component. Otherwise, everything else is the same.

#### Homepage Layout

As its name implies, this layout was created to serve as a template for a custom Homepage, but it can also be used to structure any other static page depending on your preferences.

The Homepage Layout was designed to be populated with content through the use of widgets. You cannot use the Gutenberg editor to add content in the Homepage Layout.

Check out the <g-link to="/customizations#widgets">Widgets</g-link> section to learn how you can use widgets to add and position content in the Homepage Layout.

### Custom Homepage

By default, the homepage will display the latest blog posts.
In order to display a static page on the homepage:

- Create a page and set it to use the Homepage Layout. Give the page a title (e.g **Homepage**).
- Create another page and give a title of your choice(e.g. Blog).
- Go to **Dashboard** > **Settings** > **Reading**, and set your homepage display to the static page. Then set your Homepage to display the Homepage(the static page we created above) and set your posts to be displayed on the Blog page.

![Reading Settings](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/creativecommons-base/assets/content-images/customizations/reading-settings.png)
