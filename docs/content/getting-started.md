## Installation Guide

1. Download the <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/wp-theme-base/archive/master.zip">zip</a> package of the theme.
2. Unzip to your wp-content/themes directory.
3. Navigate to the wp-theme-base directory and run the command below on the terminal, to install all the necessary package dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```
One of the installed dependencies is  [Queulat](https://github.com/felipelavinz/queulat). In-order to initialize Queulat in the project, follow the instructions provided in [feliperlavinz/queulat](https://github.com/felipelavinz/queulat#loading-queulat-as-mu-plugin). 

<br/>
Alternatively, to initialize Queulat navigate to the mu-plugins directory. The mu-plugins directory is in the root of the wp-content folder. Itâ€™s automatically created when you install Queulat using composer. At the root of the mu-plugins directory create an index.php file. Then copy and paste the code below:

<CopyToClipBoard :text="queulatSettings "/>

4. Start your development server and activate the CC WP Base Theme in your local WordPress Dashboard.
