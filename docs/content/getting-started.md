To get started you have to first install the CC WP Base Theme locally. 

## Requirements

- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/): Version 5.2 or greater

1. Download the [zip]() package of the theme.
2. Unzip to your wp-content/themes directory.
3. Navigate to the wp-theme-base directory and run the command below on the terminal, to install all the necessary package dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```
One of the installed dependencies is Queulat. In-order to initialize [Queulat](https://github.com/felipelavinz/queulat) in the project, follow the instructions provided in [feliperlavinz/queulat](https://github.com/felipelavinz/queulat#loading-queulat-as-mu-plugin).

Alternatively, to initialize Queulat navigate to the mu-plugins directory. The mu-plugins directory is in the root of the wp-content folder. Itâ€™s automatically created when you install Queulat using composer. At the root of the mu-plugins directory create an index.php file. Then copy and paste the code below:
