The recommended way to edit the CC WP Base Theme is to use the [CC WP Base Theme Starter](#). The CC WP Base Theme Starter is a [child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/#what-is-a-child-theme) of the CC WP Base Theme. 

According to the [WordPress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Developer_Documentation):

>A child theme inherits the look and feel of the parent theme and all of its functions, but can be used to make modifications to any part of the theme. In this way, customizations are kept separate from the parent theme’s files. Using a child theme lets you upgrade the parent theme without affecting the customizations you’ve made to your site.

_Ensure that the CC WP Base theme is installed  i.e., it is present in the `wp-content/themes` folder, before you install and activate the CC WP Base Theme Starter._
