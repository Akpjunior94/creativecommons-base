Updates can be safely carried out since we are using a child theme all data and customization is preserved.
But, since this theme is not officially uploaded to the WordPress repository any new updates on the parent theme will not automatically show on your Dashboard.
So,as a user it is your responsibility to ensure the theme is up to date. To do that you must ensure that your fork is in sync with the parent remote repository. View [Syncing a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork) to learn how you can do that.
